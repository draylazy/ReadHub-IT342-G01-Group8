## 🚀 Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.  
The build is minified and filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to deploy!  
See more about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`
⚠️ **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!  
It copies all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control.  
You don’t have to use eject — the curated setup works well for small and medium deployments.
